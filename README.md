# üåé Contributing

You can add new responses to Loritta Helper following these steps:



First of all, you need to create a new class with a name that can describe what your response is, something like `ProfileBackgroundResponse.kt`, at the package: `https://github.com/xGabrielDEV/LorittaHelper/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/net/perfectdreams/loritta/helper/serverresponses/{language}/name.kt`



Let's suppose you're going to create a response that will answer people about how to earn sonhos. The name should be something like `HowToGetSonhosResponse` or something related.



Loritta detects the question using [RegEx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), there are some materials that I would like to recommend:

* Tests: https://regexr.com/
* Guide: https://medium.com/@alexandreservian/regex-um-guia-pratico-para-express%C3%B5es-regulares-1ac5fa4dd39f



Now, you need to make your class extends `RegExResponse`, so it can be considered by Lori.



You should add the RegEx patterns at the class `init` block, something like that:

```kotlin
init {
    patterns.add("como")
    patterns.add("ganha|obtem|receber")
    patterns.add("sonhos|dreams|moedas|dinheiro".toPattern(Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE)) // CASE_INSENSITIVE will make it Case Insensitive, so it consider lower case and upper case questions.
}
```



After that, you want to send the answer if the user asked this kind of question, so you need to add a method called `getResponse()`, it should look something like that:

```kotlin
override fun getResponse(): List<LorittaReply> = listOf(
    LorittaReply(Emotes.LORI_OWO, "You can earn sonhos using `+daily`."),
    LorittaReply(Emotes.LORI_PAT, "Or betting with users using `+coinflip bet`")
)
```



And then you can search for the class`net/perfectdreams/loritta/helper/serverresponses/{language}Responses.kt`, you can add your response there to register it.



If you are unsure if what you did works, you can do [unit tests](https://github.com/xGabrielDEV/LorittaHelper/tree/main/src/test/kotlin/responses/portuguese)!
